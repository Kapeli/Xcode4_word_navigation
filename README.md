### Description

This is a Xcode4 plugin which modifies the way ⌥← and ⌥→ keys work in Xcode. In a nutshell, standard OS X word navigation doesn't make sense when dealing with code.

This plugin changes that, so that symbols are also taken into account while navigating. Therefore, characters like "{" and "}" will be treated as words.

### Installation

Download and compile the project (the plugin will be installed during build process).
